# CVD Risk Prediction using AI Analysis of Retinal Images

## Overview
The CVD risk prediction project utilizes AI analysis of retinal images to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed to extract features from retinal images and classify patients into different risk categories.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a robust and accurate system capable of identifying individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease using retinal image analysis. By leveraging CNNs and AI techniques, we aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of CVD risk prediction compared to traditional methods.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
The project collects a comprehensive dataset of retinal images along with corresponding patient data, including demographic information, medical history, and cardiovascular risk factors.

### Preprocessing
Extensive preprocessing techniques are applied to enhance retinal image quality, remove noise, and standardize image features. This includes image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to ensure consistent input data for the CNN model.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
A CNN architecture is developed and trained using TensorFlow and Keras to perform feature extraction and classification tasks on retinal images. The CNN model learns to identify patterns and features indicative of cardiovascular risk factors.

### Model Evaluation
The trained CNN model is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) on a separate test dataset. Performance is assessed in comparison to existing risk prediction models and clinical guidelines.

## Results
The CVD risk prediction model demonstrates promising performance in accurately identifying individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease based on retinal image analysis. The CNN model achieves high accuracy and sensitivity, providing valuable insights for early intervention and preventive care.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of additional patient data and clinical variables to further enhance model performance and predictive accuracy.
- Deployment of the CNN model as part of a comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment tool for healthcare providers and medical professionals.
- Continuous refinement and optimization of the model using feedback from clinical trials and real-world applications.
